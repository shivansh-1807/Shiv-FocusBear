# 🏆 Professionalism at Focus Bear — Reflection

## Examples of Professional vs. Unprofessional Behaviour in a Casual Work Environment
- **Professional:** Respecting deadlines, using polite and clear language in messages, being punctual to meetings, listening actively during calls, offering help when teammates are struggling.
- **Unprofessional:** Ignoring messages, using disrespectful or sarcastic tones in work discussions, missing deadlines without notice, talking over others in meetings, dismissing feedback.

## Respectful Communication in Remote Teams
- Use friendly but clear language in chat tools (Slack, email, etc.).
- Avoid writing in ALL CAPS or with excessive punctuation that could seem aggressive.
- Assume good intent when reading messages — tone can be harder to read online.
- Address disagreements calmly, focusing on facts and solutions.

## Giving and Receiving Feedback Professionally
- **Giving:** Focus on specific actions or results (“Next time, let’s try X”) instead of personal traits (“You’re bad at Y”).
- **Receiving:** Listen without interrupting, ask for clarification if needed, thank the person for the feedback, and apply it where relevant.

## Personal Reflection on Teamwork & Professionalism
I’ve experienced great teamwork when team members supported each other, communicated clearly, and divided responsibilities fairly. It was effective because everyone felt heard and valued.

## My Steps for Clear, Respectful, and Inclusive Communication
- Use “we” instead of “you” in challenging conversations.
- Clarify expectations before starting a task.
- Be patient and avoid jumping to conclusions if a teammate makes a mistake.

## Creating a Positive, Fun, and Professional Work Environment
- Contribute to light-hearted conversations in chat while respecting boundaries.
- Celebrate wins and acknowledge others’ contributions.
- Step in to help when someone is overloaded.

## Preparing for Meetings
- Review the agenda and relevant documents beforehand.
- Write down questions in advance.
- Be ready to share progress updates concisely.

## Being Proactive During the Internship
- Volunteer for tasks I can handle.
- Check in with supervisors regularly without waiting to be told what to do.
- Offer solutions when raising issues.

## Following Up & Escalation
- Send a polite follow-up after 2–3 days if I don’t receive a reply.
- Escalate to a supervisor if there’s no response after a reasonable number of follow-ups.
- Only escalate urgent matters or major issues directly to the CEO.

## Things I Won’t Do
- Ignore important messages.
- Disrespect teammates or speak negatively about them.
- Share confidential or sensitive company information.
- Engage in gossip or spread rumours.
