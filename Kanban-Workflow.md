# 🏆 Milestone: Agile Workflows & Kanban

## 🔍 Research & Learn

### How does a Kanban board work, and how does it help manage workflow?
A Kanban board is a visual tool for managing work in progress, organizing tasks, and tracking their progress through various stages.  
It helps teams quickly understand what’s being worked on, what’s blocked, and what’s completed.  
By visualizing work, it makes priorities and bottlenecks clear, improving efficiency and communication.

### What do the different columns on a Kanban board represent?
Common columns include:
- **Backlog** – Tasks not yet started but planned for future work.
- **In Progress** – Tasks currently being worked on.
- **Blocked** – Tasks that cannot move forward until an issue is resolved.
- **Done** – Completed tasks ready for review or closed.

In Focus Bear’s *Windows app roadmap* board, columns include:
- **Super low priority**
- **Very low priority**
- **Blocked**
- **Next fundraising round**
(and potentially others if you scroll horizontally)

### How do tasks move through the board, and who is responsible for updating them?
Tasks are represented by cards that move from left to right across columns as work progresses.  
The team member assigned to the task is responsible for updating its status.

### What are the benefits of limiting work in progress (WIP)?
Limiting WIP helps:
- Maintain focus and prevent task overload.
- Ensure work is completed before starting new items.
- Identify and resolve bottlenecks faster.
- Improve delivery speed and quality.

## 📝 Reflection

### How does Kanban help manage priorities and avoid overload?
Kanban provides a clear visual of priorities, making it easier to focus on the most important tasks first.  
Limiting WIP ensures that we don’t take on too many tasks at once, which can reduce stress and increase quality.

### How can you improve your workflow using Kanban principles?
I can regularly update the board to reflect the true state of my work, respect WIP limits, and move tasks only when I’m ready to commit to finishing them.  
This will help keep the team informed and avoid unnecessary context-switching.

## 🛠️ Task

- Checked out Focus Bear’s Kanban board (*Windows app roadmap* on GitHub Projects).
- Observed the structure: columns include **Super low priority**, **Very low priority**, **Blocked**, and **Next fundraising round**.
- Example task: *Integrate with Azure Event Hub* currently in the **Very low priority** column.
- Each card represents a task or issue, and moves between columns to reflect its progress or priority.
- The assignee is responsible for updating a task’s status.
- I will move at least one task through the Kanban process and update its status correctly.
- **Improvement idea:** Add due dates and short descriptions to each task card for better clarity across the team.
