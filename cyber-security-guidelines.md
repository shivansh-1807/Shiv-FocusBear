### Research & Learn

**Common cyber security threats in a remote work environment:**  
- **Phishing emails/messages** tricking users into sharing passwords or clicking malicious links.  
- **Malware and ransomware** infecting devices through unsafe downloads or attachments.  
- **Man-in-the-middle attacks** when using unsecured public Wi-Fi.  
- **Weak passwords** leading to account compromise.  
- **Social engineering** where attackers manipulate people into revealing confidential info.

**Best practices for keeping devices and accounts secure:**  
- Use **strong, unique passwords** for every account.  
- Enable **two-factor authentication (2FA)** wherever possible.  
- Keep operating systems, browsers, and applications **updated**.  
- Avoid public Wi-Fi unless using a **trusted VPN**.  
- Use a **password manager** for safe storage.  
- Lock devices when not in use.  

**Why lock your computer when away:**  
- Prevents unauthorized access to sensitive data.  
- Stops others from accidentally or intentionally using your accounts.  
- Maintains confidentiality in shared or public spaces.

**Handling phishing attempts & suspicious links:**  
- Verify sender addresses and URLs before clicking.  
- Report suspicious emails/messages to the security team.  
- Never enter credentials on unknown or unexpected websites.  

**What makes a strong password & why use a password manager:**  
- Long (12+ characters), mixing uppercase, lowercase, numbers, and special characters.  
- Avoids personal info like birthdays or names.  
- A password manager securely generates and stores complex passwords.  

**Why 2FA matters & when to enable it:**  
- Adds an extra layer of security beyond passwords.  
- Prevents access even if your password is stolen.  
- Enable it for all work accounts, email, cloud storage, and password managers.
