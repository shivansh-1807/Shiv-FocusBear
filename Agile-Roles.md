## üîç Research & Learn

### Key Roles in an Agile Team

- **Developers**  
  Build and deliver product features, write code, fix bugs, and collaborate with other team members to implement solutions.  

- **QA (Quality Assurance)**  
  Ensure the product meets quality standards by writing and executing tests, finding bugs, and validating that features work as expected.  

- **Product Manager (PM)**  
  Owns the product vision, prioritizes tasks, maintains the roadmap, and ensures that the team is building the right product for the users.  

- **Agile Project Manager (Agile PM / Scrum Master)**  
  Facilitates ceremonies, removes blockers, helps the team follow Agile principles, and ensures smooth collaboration.  

- **Other Supporting Roles**  
  - **UX Designers** ‚Äì Focus on user experience, wireframes, and usability.  
  - **Stakeholders** ‚Äì Provide input, set expectations, and align the product with business goals.  
  - **Customer Support** ‚Äì Provide feedback from users and help identify pain points.  

### Collaboration in Kanban vs. Scrum
- **Scrum** ‚Äì Collaboration is structured around fixed ceremonies: sprint planning, daily stand-ups, retrospectives, and sprint reviews. Work is done in time-boxed sprints.  
- **Kanban** ‚Äì Collaboration is continuous, with tasks flowing across the board as capacity allows. The team focuses on limiting work in progress (WIP) and adjusting priorities as needed.

## üìù Reflection

### My Role
As a **Cyber Security Analyst Intern**, my role contributes to the Agile process by ensuring that product development and company operations follow secure practices. I focus on identifying risks, monitoring security practices, and suggesting improvements so that security is integrated into the workflow rather than added at the end.

### Interaction with Other Roles
My responsibilities often overlap with **Developers**, since they implement the security recommendations I make. I also interact with the **Product Manager** when discussing how security requirements fit into product priorities.

## üõ†Ô∏è Task

- **How my role fits into the Agile team:**  
  I help maintain the security of both the development process and the final product by reviewing practices, highlighting risks, and providing input on secure coding and usage.  

- **One role I frequently collaborate with:**  
  **Developers** ‚Äì I can improve teamwork by providing clear, actionable security guidelines and offering to review their work proactively instead of only pointing out problems later. This helps build trust and ensures security is part of the process from the start.
