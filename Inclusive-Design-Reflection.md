# 🧑‍🤝‍🧑 Working with Vulnerable Populations — Reflection

## Adjusting My Communication Style
To be more inclusive of neurodivergent users and teammates, I will:
- Use **clear, concise, and direct language** without unnecessary jargon.
- Provide **written summaries** of important discussions so information isn’t lost.
- Avoid ambiguous requests — clearly define expectations, deadlines, and next steps.
- Be patient and give people extra time to process and respond.

## Common Accessibility Pitfalls to Avoid
- **Overwhelming UI** with too many options, animations, or notifications at once.
- **Sensory overload** through bright colors, flashing elements, or loud sounds.
- **Complex navigation** that forces users to remember too many steps.
- **Assuming one working style fits all** instead of allowing flexibility.

## One Practical Change I Can Make
I will create **structured and predictable layouts** in my work (both in design and communication) so users and teammates always know where to find key information without unnecessary searching or guesswork.

## First-Person Account — Key Insight
After reading a personal blog post from a person with ADHD about productivity apps, I learned that:
- Many tools **punish inconsistency** (e.g., breaking a streak), which can feel discouraging rather than motivating.
- People with ADHD benefit from **positive reinforcement** and **gentle reminders** rather than pressure-based tactics.

## Design / Communication Improvement
Replace **negative or guilt-inducing messages** with **encouraging, supportive language** when users miss a task or habit.

## Practice — Supportive Response Example
> *Hi there, I understand it can be tough to stay on track, especially when your energy or focus shifts unexpectedly. Remember, every small step counts — even if you didn’t complete everything today, you made progress! Let’s focus on what worked for you today, and we can adjust your plan together so it feels more manageable.*
