## üîç Research & Learn

### What is Agile, and how does it differ from traditional project management?
- **Agile** is an iterative and flexible approach to project management that emphasizes collaboration, customer feedback, and adaptability to change.  
- **Traditional (Waterfall) project management** follows a linear sequence: plan ‚Üí design ‚Üí build ‚Üí test ‚Üí release. Agile, instead, breaks work into smaller increments with continuous feedback.

### What are the core values and principles of Agile?  
From the **Agile Manifesto**:  

**4 Core Values**  
1. Individuals and interactions **over** processes and tools  
2. Working software **over** comprehensive documentation  
3. Customer collaboration **over** contract negotiation  
4. Responding to change **over** following a plan  

**12 Principles** (summarized):  
- Satisfy the customer through early and continuous delivery.  
- Welcome changing requirements.  
- Deliver working software frequently.  
- Collaborate closely with business and developers.  
- Build projects around motivated individuals.  
- Use face-to-face (or direct) communication.  
- Working product is the primary measure of progress.  
- Maintain sustainable work pace.  
- Continuous attention to technical excellence.  
- Simplicity is essential.  
- Self-organizing teams produce the best results.  
- Regularly reflect and adapt for improvement.

### Scrum vs Kanban
- **Scrum**  
  - Works in fixed-length **sprints** (e.g., 2 weeks).  
  - Includes ceremonies: sprint planning, daily stand-ups, sprint review, and retrospectives.  
  - Roles: Product Owner, Scrum Master, Development Team.  
  - Good for teams that want structure, time-boxed goals, and clear deliverables.  

- **Kanban**  
  - Uses a **continuous flow** of work.  
  - Tasks move across a **Kanban board** (Backlog ‚Üí In Progress ‚Üí Review ‚Üí Done).  
  - Focuses on limiting Work In Progress (WIP) to avoid overload.  
  - Good for dynamic environments where priorities change often.  

---

### Why does Focus Bear lean towards Kanban instead of Scrum?
- The Focus Bear team is **small and flexible**, so priorities change quickly.  
- Kanban allows continuous delivery and immediate reprioritization without waiting for the next sprint.  
- Less ceremony, more focus on flow and adaptability.

## üìù Reflection

### Benefits of Agile
- Encourages adaptability and quick responses to change.  
- Promotes close collaboration and transparency.  
- Breaks large projects into smaller, manageable tasks.  
- Helps deliver value to users faster.  

### Challenges of Agile
- Can feel chaotic without discipline.  
- Requires strong communication and alignment.  
- Priorities may shift often, which can be stressful.  

### How Agile principles help my role
As a **Cyber Security Analyst Intern**, Agile principles help me integrate security early into development, provide fast feedback on risks, and adapt quickly as threats evolve.

## üõ†Ô∏è Task

### Main differences between Scrum and Kanban (in my own words)
- Scrum is **structured around sprints and ceremonies**, while Kanban is **flexible and continuous**.  
- Scrum works best when goals can be defined in short cycles, Kanban works best when priorities shift frequently.  
- Scrum assigns clear roles, Kanban encourages shared responsibility.  

### One Agile principle most useful for my work
**"Continuous attention to technical excellence and good design enhances agility."**  
This principle fits my role since maintaining strong security practices (technical excellence) directly improves the agility and reliability of the product.
